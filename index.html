        <p><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks" target="_blank">Rosa Louise McCauley Parks</a>, often hailed as the "Mother of the Civil Rights Movement," was an African American activist born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. Her courageous act of defiance on December 1, 1955, when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Alabama, sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. This boycott, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others, lasted 381 days and brought attention to the injustice of segregation laws in the South. 
        </p>
        <p>Parks' refusal to comply with segregation laws wasn't a spontaneous act of rebellion but a deliberate decision. Her quiet strength and dignity in the face of discrimination galvanized the African American community and inspired a new wave of activism. Her arrest led to her conviction, but it also ignited a firestorm of protests and ultimately led to the desegregation of public transportation in Montgomery and, later, across the United States.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond her pivotal role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Rosa Parks continued her activism throughout her life. She worked alongside civil rights leaders, fought for voter registration, and advocated for racial and social justice. Parks' actions symbolize the power of ordinary individuals to effect extraordinary change and remain a testament to the importance of standing up against injustice, regardless of the personal consequences.
        </p>
        <p>Rosa Parks' legacy extends far beyond her iconic act of defiance. She became an international symbol of resistance to racial segregation and oppression. Her bravery and determination catalyzed the civil rights movement, paving the way for significant legislative changes and inspiring generations of activists worldwide. Parks' contributions to history are profound, and her name will forever be synonymous with the ongoing struggle for equality and justice.
